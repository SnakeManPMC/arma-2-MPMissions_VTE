EAST groups:
vcrecon1 -> vcrecon18 groups, 4 waypoints + cycle. meaning 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 setwwpos.
vcinf1 -> vcinf9, 1 guard waypoint.

WEST groups:
usinf1 -> usinf4, 4 waypoints + cycle. meaning 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 setwwpos.
transp1 no waypoints.


ok the gookstations are too mechanical, also they appear to fuck up, all of the sudden the leader appears to be separated from the rest of the group.

no victory conditions.

add gook base?

add the recon teams, when they find you the report back to gook base.


--- bugs
lz script starts to unload stuff even as helo is still landing, make sure helo is <2m in height and possibly get out the crew too.


--- idea

I'm imagening this to my lame NAM12 or 25km island where the bases are in the outer boundary of the island landmass and the thick gook jungle is on the center. 
 
You as US soldier start from the big HQ on the outer boundary. You most likely use land based vehicles or perhaps go even on foot to the jungle, a longish way I had it planned. In there you fight and clear a LZ, setup defensive position there. This LZ position would be up to you, no scripted pre-set positions would be used (other than the clearings, ie LZ slots in the island). 
 
Then you call from radio to the HQ which sends helicopters to bring in additional defenses and after they have arrived (one dispatch of Hueys) and start to patrol the area around the LZ, you get to call like Chinook which brings in ammo, perhaps vehicle like jeep, barrels, medic tent (with AI medics standing by) and "base decor" into the LZ. also static M2 machine gun would be placed there. Also lets not forget the CoC M252 mortars which would be deployed there for your fire support. In other terms, a LZ was established there or "field HQ" which would be your base of operations. 
 
Now you could start to patrol the nearby areas and ambush/hit or otherwise to make gooks life miserable. When you run out of ammo or need reinforcements etc, you have the nice fieldhq/LZ nearby and you dont need to go long way back to the main HQ base. 
 
AI helos would then automatically catch these LZ's so they would bring in more AI squads to fight in the jungle. Gooks of course would also get "recon" of the LZ and try to assault it etc. 
 
This could be make to a fluid war situation where you capture LZ or two, and then the Charlie hits you back with a vengeance, you might lose LZ or so, you'd have to scrap your current mission and rush back to a LZ to defend it etc. All kinds of neat trickery could be done in the highly random createunit nasty way.
